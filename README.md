***Lost Woods***

Lost Woods is a CLI game inspired by the Legend of Zelda series. It is my first Pyton project.

In this game, you will be navigating the Lost Woods in the kingdom of Hyrule. Along the way, you will find treasures and encounter enemies.
If you navigate the forest successfully, you will come to your ultimate battle.

Follow the prompts to play.

Tip: Make note of the directions you choose. The code contains a loop that moves to the next step if the correct direction is chosen. You will know that the correct direction has been chosen if you come upon a chest.

To play, download the Lost_Woods folder and its contents. Then open your command line tool of choice and run the following command - "python lost_woods.py". You will need to have python installed in order to run the game.

***Potential Updates***
- Update flow of battles with additional helper text to reduce confusion.
- Update enemy health indicator so it does not show a negative value when they have been defeated.
- Incorporate a database that stores users and their scores (see LostWoodsDB repo).
- Host the game on a web server so it can be played online.
